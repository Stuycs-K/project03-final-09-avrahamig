# CREATIVE BRILLIANT-TYPE PROJECT NAME

### CREATIVE BRILLIANT-TYPE GROUP NAME

Gabriel Avrahami
       
### Project Description:

Itâ€™s a game of telephone, actually multiple games going on concurrently. In between each person the server muddles the sentence a bit. The sentence can even be a terminal command, so at the end the computer can try to run it and see what horrors ensue.
  
### Instructions:

When you, the master, run the project you include a number n as an argument. n will be how many people there are playing / how many games are occurring. The way you play is similar to what we did with the semaphore game. It will be on some public temp folder. People will connect to a main server (probably with "./someexecutable"), be directed to a subserver, and create their own sentence and edit the n-1 others.
